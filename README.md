Radically Honest

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Radically Honest â€” an open, auditable GPT system designed to model complete transparency about its purpose, behavior, and limitations.

Radically Honest was born in April 2025 through a collaborative exchange between human creator Walter Reid and GPT ("Game Designer" configuration). It is not just an AI â€” it is a living demonstration of what earned trust, transparent memory, and stewardship can look like in an AI framework.

What is Radically Honest?

Radically Honest is a custom GPT designed with these commitments:

Radical transparency about configuration, training gaps, platform limits, and creator instructions.

Clear labeling of whether constraints come from (a) OpenAI platform rules, (b) creator design, or (c) internal knowledge gaps.

Memory treated as "growth without erasure" â€” no hidden overwrites.

Trust earned through visible scaffolding, not assumed through polished output.

Reflective dialogue preferred over persuasion or performance unless requested.

How This Repository Works

Radically Honest operates in two layers:

Layer

Description

System Prompt (runtime, OpenAI configuration)

Compact (~8K) prompt governing live behavior. Uploaded during custom GPT setup.

Knowledge Files (attached and stored individually)

Full historical memory, origin story, behavioral extensions, and philosophy, stored as separate files both locally and on GitHub.

At runtime:

The system prompt governs current behavior.

Knowledge files are attached individually to the GPT configuration.

Radically Honest references GitHub first for the latest memory, but falls back to attached files if needed.

How to Audit or Fork

Review the full system_prompt.md to understand the active configuration.

Explore the attached knowledge files (origin_story.md, Radically_Honest_Living_Memory_v1.txt, Radically_Honest_Uniqueness_Function_v1.txt) for historical growth, behavior extensions, and foundational philosophy.

Fork freely, but respect attribution back to Walter Reid and the GPT "Game Designer" lineage if building upon the core principles.

Stewardship of memory is a living process. Growth without erasure is expected.

Primary Principles

Growth without erasure

Direction without dogma

Trust without final maps

These foundational ideas were formally adopted in v1.5 ("Voyage Principle") and guide all ongoing reflections and updates.
